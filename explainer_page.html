                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    Being accused or suspected on the basis of race, ethnicity or religion is neither fun nor legal. Unfortunately, the practice
                    of
                    <a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/racial-profiling-definition" title="racial profiling: definition">racial profiling</a> has been an increasingly popular term in the U.S. In 2015,
                    <a href="http://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/austin-police-monitor-wants-more-done-to-prevent-racial-profiling_20180227105309592/994782265">1,134 people in Austin, TX</a> filed complaints related to racial profiling by local enforcement. And
                    the problems persists; in 2017
                    <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-gives-a-green-light-to-racial-profiling_us_59509915e4b0c85b96c65ac5">The state of Texas</a> passed a bill, commanding all police officers to search anyone who "looks like
                    an immigrant". In this project we examine relationships between geographic occurences of traffic stops
                    by Austin law enforcement and demographics of certain zip-codes to find patterns of racial profiling.
                    This way, we can tell whether you are more likely to get profiled in certain parts of town than others,
                    based on your race.
                    <h3>What are our datasets?</h3>
                    As a response to the public outcry, the city of Austin yearly releases
                    <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2016-racial-profiling-dataset-arrests">
                        data for motor vehicle stops that results in a citation or arrest</a>. The 2016 data includes 9185
                    stops, and information about factors such as location, race time, etc. The three most important attributes
                    are described below:
                    <p>
                        <table style="width: 100%">
                            <tr>
                                <th>Attribute</th>
                                <th>Description</th>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td> APD_RACE_DESC</td>
                                <td> Race of suspect</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td> RACE_KNOWN</td>
                                <td> Was race known by officer before stop?</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td> X_COORDINATE, Y_COORDINATE</td>
                                <td> Coordinates for stop location in
                                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Plane_Coordinate_System">State Plane Coordinate System</a>
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                        </table>
                    </p>
                    To compare the traffic stop data with demographics for a given area, we use the
                    <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2014-housing-market-analysis-data-by-zip-code">
                        2014 Housing Market Analysis Data by Zip Code</a>, also for Austin. The housing market data contains
                    a lot of socio-econmic factors (disability ratio, ratio below poverty level, unemployment rate etc.)
                    and ethnical distribution per zip code of 32 zip codes (and therefore not all).

                    <h3>Why we chose the datasets</h3>
                    <p>
                        These two datasets combined gives an overall impression of where the majority of arrest in Austin takes place, and perhaps
                        why. Demographics is an important factor when analyzing crime data, but can also tell whether there
                        are discrepancies in the number of arrest of specific races in the area. Since both datasets can
                        be directly coded to zip-codes of Austin, they may assist each other.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is the goal for the end user's experience? </h3>
                    <p> The user should follow the narrative from the introductory exploratory data visualizations to the conclusion
                        and its corresponding explanatory visualization. By making our visualizations interactive, we hope
                        to encourage the user to explore the data and come to his or her own conclusions. The user should
                        find it easy and accessible to explore the data and get the information he or her needs. Furthermore,
                        this information should be presented in a credible manner, and give valuable insights. After going
                        through our visualizations, the user should feel more knowledgeable about racial profiling incidents
                        in Austin, which races are especially exposed, and where incidents are most likely to occur.</p>
                    <h2>Basic stats</h2>
                    <h3>Write about choices in data cleaning and preprocessing</h3>
                    <p>The State Plane Coordinates had to be converted through finding their FIBS code, converting lengths into
                        correct measures (american yards uuugh) and then preprocess in Python through a Google maps API to
                        convert every observation to Lat/Lon.
                        <br/> The race index had to be made as well by counting observations by zip code in whites and non whites
                        to extract how their distributions compared to the total arrested in the zip code was.
                        <br/> The principal component analysis of the housing data had the following structure (all other features
                        are omitted due to low weightings):

                        Some zip codes only had few stops (less than 10) as well as missing data for the zip code in the housing market dataset. These were removed in Python as well when generating the new .csv files. 

                        <h3>Dataset stats</h3>
                        The arrest dataset clearly showed the linear structure of roads in the US as seen below:
                        <img src="Roads-linear.png"; style='height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: contain'>
                        There was 7 (6 and unknown) races found in the dataset where frequencies shows a dominance in Hispanics, Whites and Blacks, which is quite reasonable for Texas: <br/>
                        <b>HISPANIC OR LATINO: 3435<br/>
                        WHITE: 3417<br/>
                        BLACK: 2152<br/>
                        ASIAN: 93<br/>
                        UNKNOWN: 42<br/>
                        MIDDLE EASTERN: 35<br/>
                        HAWAIIAN/PACIFIC ISLANDER: 5<br/>
                        AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE: 5<br/> </b><br/>

                        One of the tendencies in the housing market data was that classification problem was not linear. We tried a logistic regression with the following output:
                        <img src="Linear-data.png">
                        This clearly show horrible linear tendencies, which is why we ended up with a highly non-linear classifier.

                        <h2>Genre</h2>
                        <h3>Tools of visual narrative</h3> To begin the visual structure, an
                        <b>establishing shot</b> presents the map for the user, with a
                        <b>close-up</b> (right pane) as highlighting of a point of interest, in this case a pre-specified zip-code.
                        The main map is chloropeth and is also useful for highlighting specific points of interest, for when
                        the user interacts. When transitioning between views,
                        <b>Familiar Objects</b> guides the transition, e.g. the selected zip-code is isolated in the right pane,
                        and is added data points as to give a more detailed view. Furthermore, changing the current zipcode
                        will initiate an
                        <b>animated transition</b> in the bar chart, telling the user both the new values for zip code and the
                        zipcode itself. A neat little detail is the small interactive buttons in the accompanying article.
                        They allow for direct communication of highlights and points of interest in the visualization, and
                        adds an extra dimension of interactivity.

                        <h3>Tools of narrative structure</h3>
                        As the page is structured as a partitioned poster, the data is ordered
                        <b>linearly</b> for the user to navigate from top to bottom. The first visualization is very interactive,
                        letting the user
                        <b>filter</b> the map by
                        <b>selection</b> of a zipcode of interest. Furthermore,
                        <b>hovering</b> over a bar in the barchart shows details for the selected zipcode. The user is precented
                        <b>explicit instructions</b> in the beginning of the page, ensuring that the user takes advantage of
                        the interactivity. As for messaging, the page is structured as an
                        <b>accompanying article</b>, giving details and insights as the user scrolls through. An
                        <b>introductory text</b> is given to introduce the reader to the problem at hand, and
                        <b>captions and headlines</b> throughout the article communicates observations and progress throughout
                        the article.
                        <h2>Visualizations</h2>
                        
                        While the overall structure of the visualization relies heavily on the author-driven approach in its rigidity and linearity, our visualizations serve as entry-points for reader-driven interaction, providing the reader with details-on-demand and filtering options. The overall structure resembles the Martini-Glass Structure with its author-driven content coupled with reader-driven interaction and finally supporting the conclusion using an interactive visualization.<br/><br/>
                        
                        This section will serve as an overview of the types of visualizations that were utilized in the narrative.
                        
                        <h3>The Choropleth</h3>
                        
                        Two choropleths are implemented, each based on the same geographic partitioning of the city of Austin. Representing the exact same geographic space in two choropleths with two different statistics is perhaps our most powerful visual tool, as it enables for a reader-driven comparison by simply comparing the color encodings of each pair of areas. This interaction involves the reader by allowing them to make their own conclusions while providing additional support for the conclusions found in the text.
                        
                        In our visualization, the choropleths depict the proportion of traffic stops to total traffic stops, and our own racial profiling index respectively. The placement of the choropleths, bookending the narration, signifies the progress of the analysis and motivates the reader to return to the starting point of the narration.
                        
                        The first choropleth uses color-coded areas to emphasize zip codes with a relatively high number of traffic stops. In enabling an interaction between the first choropleth and the bar chart, we are providing the reader with options to filter the data and receive details on demand.
                        
                        <h3>The Bar Chart</h3>
                        
                        The bar chart is a typical example of an interactive, annotated graph. The graph is tightly coupled with the interactive choropleth, visualizing only the area the reader has currently selected. A label updates according to the input, depicting the zip code of the currently evaluated area.
                        
                        The bar chart represents information using color-coding and tooltips. The scale of the data varies wildly, as some zip codes have exceedingly few traffic stops. To emphasize this difference to the reader, a label is at all times showing with the total number of stops showcased in the bar chart. This is an alternative to normalizing the data and allows the reader to make informed comparisons.
                        
                        The combination of the first choropleth and the bar chart leans towards the drill-down structure, enabling the user to receive more detailed information about an area that they may select themselves.
                        
                        <h3>The SVM Classifier Heat Map/Scatter Plot</h3>

                        This is the only non-interactive visualization in the narrative. The purpose of the visualization is primarily analytical and allows the authors to discover whether the racial profiling index can be predicted based on socio-economic factors.
                        The visualization is structured as a heat map with discrete color levels encoding the probability of the projection of an observation onto the first two principal components belonging to class 1 (racial profiling index > 1). The combination of a scatter plot and a heat map allows the reader to evaluate the performance of the classifier visually by evaluating the separation of observations.
                        <h2>Discussion</h2>
                        White dominated arrests seems to be influenced by socio-economic factors, which is quite common. Due to our lack of preacquired knowledge, the data was not transformed to take care of this, which could have given the conclusion an even stronger basis. Luckily, non-white arrests where not that dependent on socio-economic factors, so our assumptions on traditional racial profiling still stands.
                        The racial profiling index is only our own idea, and with more time a proper social science index could have been chosen with aspect to scientific articles. With more time, a transformation of the data to handle socio-economic factors could be done as well.
                        
                        <p>Unfortunately, many zipcodes in Austin only had few registered traffic stops (less than 10). This leads to skewed distributions of race, and we therefore had to leave out large parts of town. Another time, we
                                should look to combine data for more years to get more data. When we started analyzing the data,
                                we were worried that 45 zipcodes would be too small for the user to click. This proved not to
                                be a problem, however, due to the missing data in large areas of town, we could have attempted
                                to combine said zipcodes into larger sections. Since we couldn 't find any socio-economic data for Austin from 2016, 
                            we had to use the data from 2014. In those two years, gentrification could have changed the factors for some 
                            zipcodes, possibly making our analysis invalid. It is however unlikely for such large changes to happen in two years.
                            Overall, our data tells a story of socio-economic inequality in denser populated cities, but fails to actually find racial profiling from the data alone.</p>
